# Create book covers out of AI generated Japanese Newspapers?
# Create an AI agant that creates Art from the content you consume on a daily or from your daily diary. Content to Art would be an interesting concept!
# Check if someone has done that before!
# Check if there are C++ puzzles!
# Check library for poker books!
# Check out front end development a bit more native javascript and react
# Do a course on Github maybe even with certification, if they have it!

# Write program that tells you how much coffein you have left in your system!

# Why use pyspark streaming instead of kafka?

# Do the Pyspark course first! Then Google cloud and then the dpt course. Or dpt before Google cloud? 
# Maybe do a databricks course before the final google cloud course

# Would there be something cool to do with structured streaming?

# Maybe do a Kafka course?
